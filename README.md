Bitcoin’s new all-time high has increased attention across the broader crypto market, making data-driven analysis essential for understanding price behavior. To evaluate Solana’s market dynamics, I built an interactive dashboard using one year of historical data (Feb 8, 2024 – Feb 7, 2025). The dashboard combines key price and network indicators—daily price, market capitalization, 24-hour trading volume, daily transactions, and active addresses—along with technical indicators and statistical correlations to uncover trends and anticipate potential price movements.

1) Price Trend Analysis with SMA Indicators
The dashboard applies Simple Moving Averages (SMA 10 and SMA 20) to identify trend shifts. When SMA 10 crosses above SMA 20, it signals bullish momentum and may precede upward price movement. When SMA 10 crosses below SMA 20, it indicates bearish momentum and a potential decline. This crossover approach reduces short-term noise and highlights underlying trends, supporting momentum-based trading insights.

2) Correlation Between Price and Daily Active Addresses
A scatter plot with a fitted trend line shows a positive relationship between Solana’s price and daily active addresses. This suggests that higher prices often coincide with increased user activity and network engagement, reflecting stronger adoption and rising market confidence in the Solana ecosystem.

3) Market Capitalization and Price Trends
Tracking price and market cap over time helps interpret broader market behavior. Parallel growth between these metrics can indicate sustained capital inflows and investor confidence. In contrast, divergence may signal liquidity shifts, changes in circulating supply, or evolving investor sentiment.

4) Key Insights and Enhancements
Future improvements could include Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to strengthen trend-reversal confirmation. Analyzing 24-hour volume surges around SMA crossovers could validate breakout signals. Incorporating additional on-chain indicators—such as staking rates, whale activity, and sentiment analysis—could further improve predictive accuracy.

Overall, this dashboard offers a structured, metrics-driven framework for assessing Solana’s historical price behavior and network activity, helping traders and investors make more informed decisions grounded in quantitative patterns and correlations.
